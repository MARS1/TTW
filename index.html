        <h3 class="pB5 text-center">Initial Summary:</h3>
        <p>
          The Ticket to Work Re-design revolves around the main recommendations on the Agenda (See executive summary page 1) that are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul class="small-12 large-push-1 large-11 mB10">
          <li><strong>Recommendation 1:</strong> Make it easier to find information on the site</li>
          <li><strong>Recommndation 2:</strong> Make site mobile friendly</li>
          <li><strong>Recommendation 3:</strong> Bring new content front and center and align with choice messaging<!-- </li>
          <li><strong>Recommendation 4:</strong> Connect related content across the website</li>
          <li><strong>Recommendation 5:</strong> Build out themes and topics by Audience</li>
          <li><strong>Recommendation 6:</strong> Create a Unified Multimedia Gallery</li> -->
        </ul>

        <p>While all of the recommendations have not been explored in this presentation it was important for me to get this initial piece out of my head to then begin to work on incorporating the rest of the recommendations into my thought process.</p>
        <p>The idea from a user experience perspsective is to make the content easier to find. What remains to be clear to me is exactly what that content is, but that is simply semantics that will become clearer to me as Debbie and I move on with this project. As the design progresses so too must the exact type of content be clearly identified in order to help us holisitically understand why that information is important and to whom specifically from our key audiences does that information benefit. Only then can we begin to determine where to place it.</p>

        <p>I believe i'm on the same page as the team when I say that the best user experience is serving up what the user needs and specifically what is relevant to that key audience only. I attempt to briefly illustrate that in the following examples by introducing content based on introductory statements such as "Are you visiting us as a: Beneficiary or Service Provider". This concept, while not fully fleshed out in the mockups, will engage the user to interact with their search in a more meaningful way and won't obfuscate what they need to do or where they should begin to look.</p>

        <p>Keeping choices to a minimum from the beginning and (possibly) using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">cookies</a> to track a users preferences are all part of a larger role in keeping the user on the right path (in terms of finding information) and from being unecessarily overwhelemed.</p>

        <p>Visual design and user experience alone cannot be the end all solution. Tracking the devices our users are accessing the site on, what pages they tend to stay on the longest or repetitively access, as well as the browsers they use are all part of an ongoing investigation that will guide us in how best to serve the end user with what they are looking for.</p>

        <p> <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> will play an increasingly important role when determinining these factors, I also believe introducing new third party solutions (like <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a>) will allow us to make decisions based on analytics and not feelings or preferences. This is key, especially if we get hung up on 2 versions of a particular layout or idea, the best option is to put them both to the test; split test (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B testing</a>) to be precise.</p>
        <p>With this new re-design comes more than just a new look, but rather a new way to enhance how site visitors experience the content, while testing all that we do, and allowing our analytics to guide our efforts in the most efficient manner possible.</p>

        <h3 class="pT5 pB5 text-center">The Color Palette</h3>
        <p>While the current identity is overall clean and consistent it lacks (as has been noted) a fun and vibrant feel to it. The energy is muted and this re-design is the opportunity to stir things up in that department. Also based on the initial style tiles meeting I was wanting to introduce yellow but failed to do so in one of the examples we presented. If used sparingly I think it would be a great companion to the emerald green that I've introduced in this version (also used in the logo) and act as a solid primary to secondary colors as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogous_colors">analogous colors</a>. The teal and dark emerald are monochromatic tones from the main emerald green. </p>

            <h3 class="pT5 pB5 text-center">Logo Concepts</h3>
            <h5 class="mT2 mB2 text-center gray">Logo Concept 1:</h5>
            <p>The initial concept began from the idea of a path or road to employment based on current ideas and print materials. I wanted to incorporate that into the logo in a clean and bold way while still creating a logo that worked on a wide range of marketing and promotional materials and advertisement.</p>
            <img src="img/TTW-Logo-v1b.png" alt="">
      
            <h5 class="mT5 mB2 text-center gray">Logo Concept 2:</h5>
            <p>The Second concept was taking the path and making it more symmetrical and possible to multi-position it (top, bottom, right, left, etc). At this point I was also exploring a couple different color schemes based on the idea of possible themes.</p>
            <img src="img/TTW-Logo-v1d.png" alt="">
      
            <h5 class="mT2 mB2 text-center gray">Logo Concept 3:</h5>
            <p>After framing the logo in a rectangle and trying a boundless approach I started thinking about encompassing it in a circle and viewing it more like a sticker and I stuck with that version as an alternative to the stand-alone logo. It's very common for logos to have a couple versions for different use cases.</p>

            Desktop Simulation A:
          </h5>
          <p>The rough idea is to have plenty of white space (not meaning white as the color but rather empty space) playing with the idea that the first time a user visits the new version it could start off with a simple statement like "Are you visiting us as a: Beneficiary or Service Provider" and then take that key audience user to the content relevant to them as a certain user.</p>

          <p>This is not to say that they would have no way of accessing other types of information, since all information would always be accessible to any kind of key audience user. This example simply highlights the possibility of prominently sorting the content most relevant to the role of the user based on their selection of how they are visiting the site as (Beneficiary or Service Provider).</p>

            Desktop Simulation B:
          </h5>
          <p>Another notion is to just present (based on the executive summary that was produced) the highlights of the latest content like blog post, next upcoming Webinar, or even possibly "Popular Topics".</p>

          <p> In this example you don't see a latest blog post but you will further down on the mobile version. Keep in mind the viewport (whether desktkop, notebook, tablet or mobile) can present content in interchangeable ways. Simply because I haven't included a latest blog post in this version doesn't mean I wouldn't have it there. These images should stimulate conversation more than be taken literally.</p>

          <h5 class="mT2 mB2 text-center gray">
            Desktop Simulation C:
          </h5>
          <p>The fly out menu is something of a recurring pattern in the following examples, naturally it would have to be triggered by both tab and mouse click for 508 compliance, but the purpose of its' use is to unify the look of the application on all viewport sizes.</p>

          <p>Regardless of whether it's being viewed on a desktop or smaller screen device, like a tablet or mobile device, the orientation of the navigation can remain consistent from a usability standpoint.</p>

          <p>While this works in tandem with a responsive design that wasn't the main reason for its' use in these examples, but rather based on the idea that the less information presented upfront to the visitor the more engaged they will be to investigate and look for that information. By minimizing options you make the few options available more apparent.</p>

          <p> There's more on the matter to be discussed but when used with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooltip">tooltips</a>, accompanying labels and functional hovers (for desktop) and click states (for tablet and mobile) you lay the groundwork for a less intrusive experience, that is equally obvious in how it works, while maximizing screen real estate. This creates less anxiety and frustration on the user by clearing things off the screen while separating content in a more definitive manner.</p>

            Notebook Simulation A:
          </h5>
          <p>Ben has escaped the 2-Dimensional world, but it does bring up an important decision in the design process of why everything is flat. The flat design is not just a design trend but rather a very conscious decision for a few reasons.</p>
          <p> The first and most obvious is not because Ben is flat but rather done to be as un-intrusive to the user experience as possible. Too many gradients, shadows, and bevels take away from the content without adding any real value to the user experience.</p>
          <p> The second is to make the site maintainability easier in the following way:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Content may be aggregated, removed, reduced, merged, etc and this can effect intricate layouts in un-predicatable ways.</li>
            <li>The less graphic and gradient heavy the site the faster it loads, which is key for mobile, and having to maintain separate styles sheets for a desktop vs. mobile version is counter-prodcutive.</li>
            <li>Creating other color themes becomes much easier.</li>
            <li>All the styling is done through CSS and very few graphics, other than logos will be necessary. Icons and small graphics can be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG">SVG's</a> which will scale well on larger displays and retina devices or be created from pure css making them very light weight and easy to customize.</li>

            Mobile Simulation A:
          </h5>
          <p class="wht-txt">Contrary to popular belief a design doesn't just look good by making it responsive, it takes careful and thoughtful planning to make sure the experience on mobile suites the screensize it is being served on and is useful in a practical mobile user based scenario.</p>
          <p class="wht-txt"> Just serving up all the content will not do either and will hinder the otherwise practical and convenient use of the device that the information is being access from.</p>

          <p class="wht-txt">By serving up bite-sized content bits, and keeping useful information like contact and messaging at hand makes practical sense when a user is on-the-go. The following designs aim to keep the notion of simplicity but also use the colors to call attention to what is most important (the actual content that is most important for each key audience is TBD) and while the content that I choose to reflect that point may not be accurate the idea is still to use the colors to call out the latest and important information regardless of what that may be.</p>

          </h5>
          <p>True responsive design leaves the end-user in charge of how they view their content and at what size. This ties in with my earlier point about the choice of going flat in design and keeping things simple. Simplicity allows for greater adapability which is a key element of good usability. Even though iPhones are used in these examples the range of devices our visitors use will vary greatly and it is counter-productive to design for all of them.</p>
          <p> The design choices that are made upfront play a vital role in how content will adapt and conform to the viewport sizes of today and into the future, hence the point about maintainability. It's not just about content but also how content is rendered across multiple devices and browsers. Keeping the site simple will gaurantee us better leverage when tackling issues down the road.</p>

          <p>The Tablet is just another viewport size for the design but one that I believe (hopefully analytics at some point will concur) will rival desktop use since the tablet is an often used companion to the desktop in that a user can opt to finish reading up on information from the tablet that they began accessing from their desktop or mobile device.</p>
